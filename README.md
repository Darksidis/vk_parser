# vk_parser

About
-------

This is my pet project, which was created for a simple purpose - to transfer posts from my VK public to a telegram channel.


How it works
-------

The program, using the VK API methods, checks if a new post has appeared, and using, again, the VK API methods, pulls out the content of the post, saves it, and the telegram bot transfers the content to the telegram channel.


Technologies used
-------
Telegram API, VK API... That's all.
